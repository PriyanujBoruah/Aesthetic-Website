# Aesthetic-Website
A simple website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses simple concepts to make a clean and aesthetic appeal.

*This repository contains two HTML files*
One of the file contains *CSS internally using <style/> tags* while the other one uses *CSS externally i.e. using the <link/> tag* to refer to the stylesheet.
If you are the using the *HTML-only* file, it is necessary to also use the stylesheet.
This is not necessary if you use the file with both HTML and CSS.

*NOTE - While using CSS internally is easier for a single webpage, in case of multiple webpages with similar properties and linked objects, external CSS is often preferred.*

Please take note that the used images have been edited and adjusted beforehand to match the colour and vibe to the overall aesthetics of the website.
